#  Basic Chatbot — "Chatty"
###  Created by: Mehak Farman  
###  CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship — Task 4

##  Project Overview
This is **Task 4** of my **CodeAlpha Python Internship**, where I built a **simple rule-based chatbot** named **Chatty**  

The chatbot interacts with the user in a friendly, human-like way. It understands basic greetings, answers simple questions, and says goodbye politely.  
It’s a console-based Python project made to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

##  Features
--> Greets the user with a warm welcome  
--> Replies to simple questions (like “how are you”, “your name”)  
--> Responds to “thank you” and “bye”  
--> Keeps chatting until the user types “bye”  
--> Uses natural, human-like language  

##  Key Concepts Used
- **Loops** (`while True`)  
- **Conditionals** (`if-elif-else`)  
- **String Handling** (`lower()`, `in`)  
- **Input/Output**  

## How the Chatbot Works
1. The chatbot starts with a greeting.  
2. The user types something in the console.  
3. Based on keywords (like “hello”, “bye”, “how are you”), the bot replies.  
4. The chat continues until the user types **“bye”**, after which the bot ends the conversation politely.

##  Example Chat
PS C:\Users\user\Desktop\TASK3> & "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" c:/Users/user/Desktop/TASK3/chatBot.py
Hello! I’m Chatty, your friendly Python chatbot.
Type 'bye' anytime to end our chat.

You: Hello


Chatty: Hey there!  How are you doing today?


You: I AM FINE


Chatty: Hmm... I’m not sure what that means but I’ll learn someday!


You: HOW ARE YOU


Chatty: I’m just a bunch of Python code, but I’m feeling great! What about you?


You: THANK YOU


Chatty: Aww, you’re so kind! You’re welcome 


You: BYEE


Chatty: Bye-bye! Have a wonderful day ahead
